I had the best of time with the assignement even though it did give me headache after headache! I was able to do everything besides to copy it to your clipboard! I know we were able to have access to a premade html and css but I had the most time with this assignment that I was able to give the html and css my own little flare! I did have help from my sister in law who is also a web developer with this assignment! I wouldn't of had it look as good as it is now without her!
